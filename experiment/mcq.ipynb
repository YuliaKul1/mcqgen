      "THE 12 COLOUR SEASONS\n",
      "Complete Seasonal Guides\n",
      "Twelve seasons colour analysis comprises four main seasons – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. These are further divided into three sub-seasons each, resulting in twelve colour seasons in total. On the basis of the flow theory, all seasons flow into each other forming a full circle.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, you can learn more about each colour season and access the comprehensive guides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spring\n",
      "Spring is the season of renewal, painting the natural world in fresh, blooming colours. Consequently, Spring features are warm, bright and light, giving Springs an overall luminous and fresh appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spring season is divided into three sub-seasons: Bright Spring, True Spring and Light Spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Spring Colour Wheel\n",
      "Bright + Warm\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring is the combination of bright and warm. This season flows into Spring from Winter, which tints skin, hair, and eyes neutral-warm. The most prominent characteristic of Bright Springs is the clearness of their features, which gives them a bright, luminous and fresh appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reflect the naturally clear colouring of this season, Bright Spring colours are extremely saturated and bright, only rivalled in their vibrancy by Bright Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring is bright and warm. This season’s colour palette is a set of wild, vibrant colours, whose intensity can only be rivalled by the colours on the Bright Winter palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Colour Wheel\n",
      "Bright Spring is one of the three Spring seasons and sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike Bright Winter, this season is warm. However, both are sister seasons, meaning they are both a blend of Winter and Spring, with Bright Winter leaning more towards the Winter palette and Bright Spring leaning more towards the Spring palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Characteristics\n",
      "Please note: Do not worry too much if one characteristic of your appearance deviates from the below descriptions. You may still fall into this colour season if your overall appearance matches the profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a Bright Spring if the primary colour aspect of your overall appearance is bright, and the secondary aspect is warm – meaning warm colours suit you more than cooler ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you look in the mirror, the first thing you notice about your colouring is that it is highly saturated. There is no greyness in any of your features, and your appearance is vibrant and bright. There is also a very high contrast between your skin, eyes and hair. Your eyes will probably be clear and perhaps sparkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, your colouring has warmer undertones, meaning gold flatters your skin more than silver.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Examples\n",
      "Wardrobe Building Essentials\n",
      "Everything you need to build a Bright Spring wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "EXPLORE ESSENTIALS\n",
      "The Features\n",
      "I. Eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Eye Colours\n",
      "Bright Spring eyes are generally clear. Because of the high contrast with the whites of the eye, they typically stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be blue, green, topaz or even brown as long as they are bright. Bright Spring eyes have warm undertones, and you may notice a sunburst pattern on the iris, which is typical for Spring eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "II. Skin\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Skin\n",
      "Bright Spring skin comes in a broad range of shades: from fair to tan. It has either neutral or neutral-warm undertones - meaning both gold and silver look good against it, but gold look somewhat better.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Hair\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Hair Colours\n",
      "Like the skin, the hair is typically warmer and tends to develop highlights when exposed to the sun. Medium golden to dark golden blonde with highlights are very common. But copper, auburn and medium brown with reddish undertones are also possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Contrast\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring has one of the highest contrast levels between skin, hair and eyes among the twelve colour season. There is even a high contrast between the iris and the whites of the eye. This is because brightness creates contrast. In the images below, you can see how the features all contrast rather than blend into each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals who fall into the Bright Spring colour season are sometimes tricky to analyse - they may look like Bright Winters, with piercingly bright eyes and often relatively dark hair. Plus, both colour seasons' primary colour aspect is bright.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the distinguishing characteristic is the warmer, yellowish undertone of Bright Spring's features compared to Winter's cool, blue-tinted features. The colouring is slightly less intense and has a fresher feel than Bright Winter's harsher appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. The Colour Palette\n",
      "The Bright Spring colour palette is reminiscent of exotic summer holidays. From tropical waters to remote islands, these are the most saturated colours out of the twelve seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "These colours are vibrant, wild and vivid – the colours of tropical landscapes, plants and fruit. In the western part of the northern hemisphere, Bright Spring colours are present in the first spring flowers, announcing the end of the dark days of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring colouring combines brightness with warmth. And while this colour season has the typical freshness that is characteristic of all the Spring seasons, it also has some of the crisp and starker contrast of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary aspect of the Bright Spring colour palette is its vibrancy. The colours are bright and highly saturated. These are the most intense of the Spring colours. But they do retain the relative lightness of the Spring family. And so the colours are warm, fresh and full of new life, like the first budding signs of spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palette features a broad range of hues with a heavy focus on pinks and jewel-like tones, such as turquoises and lime greens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colour Dimensions\n",
      "\n",
      "On the three dimensions of colour, Bright Spring has the following settings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hue\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of Bright Spring's secondary aspect, the colours lean towards the warm end of the scale but are not extremely warm. That means they contain more yellow than blue undertones. So even if you choose blue (the coolest colour), you will find only warmer shades with a tint of yellow. Some of these are the turquoises and pastel colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Value\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour palette ranges from light to dark, but it does not include very light or dark colours. Although you may find darker shades of blue, green and purple, these are only supporting colours. Most colours cluster around the middle of the value scale, leaning slightly towards the lighter end because of the greater concentration of yellow undertones.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Chroma\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with this colour season’s primary aspect, the colours are very high in chroma; meaning they are intensely bright and vibrant. Only the sister palette Bright Winter can rival this intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Sister Palettes\n",
      "Bright Spring sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart. The colour season falls at the Winter end of the Spring family. That's why its colours are brighter, slightly darker and less warm than those of True Spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Bright Winter, the colours are similarly bright but warmer and slightly lighter. Winter's effect on Bright Spring is to turn up the saturation of Spring's naturally bright colours to maximum brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter also cools the colours somewhat. For example, Bright Winter’s fuchsias have been warmed up and introduced to the palette, but True Spring’s golden browns have been dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "As sister palettes, Bright Winter and True Spring both share Bright Spring’s aspects of bright and warm, respectively. Depending on where you fall on the Bright Spring spectrum, you can borrow some colours from your sister palettes since they are close enough to the Bright Spring colour palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you lean more towards Bright Winter, opt for the warmer shades on the Bright Winter palette – such as Honeysuckle, Beetroot Purple or Foliage. Whereas if you lean more towards True Spring, choose the brighter colours on the True Spring palette – such as Pansy, Marina or Green Flash.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Styling\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Bright Spring flows from Winter, black is included in the palette. But the best versions of black for Bright Spring are a slightly yellowish charcoal and a slightly greenish black. These are warmer and more suitable dark neutrals than the cool blue-black of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, black on its own is not flattering on a Bright Spring since you need vibrant colours to lift your appearance. It’s better to mix it with some of the other warmer, more saturated colours on the palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also darker greyish browns and warm blues which you can also use as dark neutrals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft white, a more yellowish off-white, and gentle greens act as light neutrals. These are slightly warmer than the cool, harsh whites of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the main colour aspects of Bright Spring are brightness and warmth, your worst colours are muted and cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desaturated, toned-down colours, such as dusty blues and muddy browns, will dampen your natural brightness and make you look muddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very cool colours, such as icy blues and greys, will clash with your naturally warmer colouring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Colours to Avoid\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Colour Combinations\n",
      "Technically, you can combine any of the colours on the Bright Spring palette with each other. But certain combinations will look much better than others. Those are the combinations that repeat the contrast level that is naturally present in your appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring’s natural appearance is highly contrasting because of its brightness. Therefore, the best colour combinations for your outfits are similarly contrasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obvious way to create contrast is by pairing a dark colour with a light colour, such as dark blue and light blue. This is called value contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this may not be enough contrast for a Bright Spring. Instead of value contrast, aim for hue contrast. Don’t be afraid to combine unlike colours - particularly those sitting opposite each other on the colour wheel, such as pink and green. The more unusual the combination, the more striking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other way you can create a high contrast is by combining a neutral with a bright accent colour. Either pair a dark neutral with a lighter, brighter accent colour or a light neutral and a different darker accent colour. Make sure to select different hues to create additional hue contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, always aim for at least one bright colour in your outfit. Avoid neutrals-only combinations, monochromatic looks and low contrast combinations. These will diminish your naturally vibrant colouring.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Spring is the original Spring season in the four seasons colour analysis and sits between Bright Spring and Light Spring on the seasonal flow chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its opposite season is True Autumn. And in contrast to the latter, True Spring’s appearance is bright and fresh instead of earthy and muted.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Spring is the combination of warm and bright. This season is the warmest of the Spring family, and therefore skin, hair and eyes have a very warm, sunny colouring. There is no trace of coolness in the appearance of a True Spring and like the other Spring seasons, they look fresh and glowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This season does not tolerate cool and muted colours and thus True Spring colours are intensely warm and quite saturated reminiscent of colouring pencils.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Light + Warm\n",
      "\n",
      "Light Spring is the combination of light and warm. This season flows from Spring into Summer and therefore has some of the typical Summer gentleness in the features. In addition, skin, hair and eyes are neutral-warm but are even lighter than those of the other two Spring seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order not to overpower the delicacy of this season, Light Spring colours are the lightest and least intense of the Spring family, but the palette is colourful like a box of sweets.\n",

      "True Spring is the original Spring season of the four seasons colour analysis and is the ‘standard’ Spring palette. The other two Spring palettes have been modified to accommodate the respective Winter and Summer influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Spring colouring combines warmth with brightness. This season falls at the warmest, most golden end of Spring. Therefore, the colours are warm with a clear yellow undertone. There is not a hint of coolness in this palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "The True Spring palette contains warm greens, yellows, orangey reds, peachy pinks and every shade of light brown from beige to tan. These colours are naturally yellow-based and warm.\n",

      "True Spring Colour Dimensions\n",
      "Hue\n",
      "\n",
      "Consistent with True Spring’s primary aspect, the palette sits at the warmest end of the hue scale. That means the colours contain yellow undertones but no blue ones. As a result, you will find very few shades of blue (which is the coolest colour of all) on the palette. And you will only see warmer shades of blue – such as turquoise, mint, or pastel blue – that contain a tint of yellow. Instead, there are more yellows, peachy pinks and warm greens that are naturally yellow-based.\n",
      "\n",
      "Value\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour palette is quite broad, but it is lighter in value because of the greater concentration of yellow undertones. There are no extremely dark colours on the palette. But you may find darker shades of blue or purple, which are supportive colours for the lighter tints.\n",

      "\n",
      "Chroma\n",
      "\n",

      "As sister palettes, Bright Spring and Light Spring both share True Spring’s aspects of bright and warm, respectively. Depending on where you fall on the True Spring spectrum, you can borrow some colours from your sister palettes since they are close enough to the True Spring colour palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you lean more towards Bright Spring, opt for the gentler shades on the Bright Spring palette – such as Artisan's Gold, Persimmon or Tropical green. Whereas if you lean more towards Light Spring, choose the darker colours on the Light Spring palette – such as Hot Coral, Teaberry or Poison Green.\n",

      "Neutrals\n",
      "\n",
      "True black and white (two Winter colours) are not on the True Spring colour palette. These colours are too cool and harsh for your colouring and can make you look sallow. To replace black, you have warm chocolate browns and greenish greys, which you can use as dark neutrals.\n",
      "\n",
      "For your light neutrals, you have light yellows and greens instead of whites. These are warmer and gentler than pure white.\n",

      "\n",
      "When you look in the mirror, the first thing you notice about your colouring is that it is highly saturated. There is no greyness in any of your features, and your appearance is vibrant and bright. There is also a very high contrast between your skin, eyes and hair. Your eyes will probably be clear and perhaps sparkling.\n",

      "Bright Spring eyes are generally clear. Because of the high contrast with the whites of the eye, they typically stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be blue, green, topaz or even brown as long as they are bright. Bright Spring eyes have warm undertones, and you may notice a sunburst pattern on the iris, which is typical for Spring eyes.\n",

      "\n",
      "II. Skin\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Skin\n",
      "Bright Spring skin comes in a broad range of shades: from fair to tan. It has either neutral or neutral-warm undertones - meaning both gold and silver look good against it, but gold look somewhat better.\n",

      "III. Hair\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Hair Colours\n",
      "Like the skin, the hair is typically warmer and tends to develop highlights when exposed to the sun. Medium golden to dark golden blonde with highlights are very common. But copper, auburn and medium brown with reddish undertones are also possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Contrast\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring has one of the highest contrast levels between skin, hair and eyes among the twelve colour season. There is even a high contrast between the iris and the whites of the eye. This is because brightness creates contrast. In the images below, you can see how the features all contrast rather than blend into each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals who fall into the Bright Spring colour season are sometimes tricky to analyse - they may look like Bright Winters, with piercingly bright eyes and often relatively dark hair. Plus, both colour seasons' primary colour aspect is bright.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the distinguishing characteristic is the warmer, yellowish undertone of Bright Spring's features compared to Winter's cool, blue-tinted features. The colouring is slightly less intense and has a fresher feel than Bright Winter's harsher appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. The Colour Palette\n",
      "The Bright Spring colour palette is reminiscent of exotic summer holidays. From tropical waters to remote islands, these are the most saturated colours out of the twelve seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "These colours are vibrant, wild and vivid – the colours of tropical landscapes, plants and fruit. In the western part of the northern hemisphere, Bright Spring colours are present in the first spring flowers, announcing the end of the dark days of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring colouring combines brightness with warmth. And while this colour season has the typical freshness that is characteristic of all the Spring seasons, it also has some of the crisp and starker contrast of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary aspect of the Bright Spring colour palette is its vibrancy. The colours are bright and highly saturated. These are the most intense of the Spring colours. But they do retain the relative lightness of the Spring family. And so the colours are warm, fresh and full of new life, like the first budding signs of spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palette features a broad range of hues with a heavy focus on pinks and jewel-like tones, such as turquoises and lime greens.\n",

      "On the three dimensions of colour, Bright Spring has the following settings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hue\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of Bright Spring's secondary aspect, the colours lean towards the warm end of the scale but are not extremely warm. That means they contain more yellow than blue undertones. So even if you choose blue (the coolest colour), you will find only warmer shades with a tint of yellow. Some of these are the turquoises and pastel colours.\n",

      "Bright Spring sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart. The colour season falls at the Winter end of the Spring family. That's why its colours are brighter, slightly darker and less warm than those of True Spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Bright Winter, the colours are similarly bright but warmer and slightly lighter. Winter's effect on Bright Spring is to turn up the saturation of Spring's naturally bright colours to maximum brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter also cools the colours somewhat. For example, Bright Winter’s fuchsias have been warmed up and introduced to the palette, but True Spring’s golden browns have been dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "As sister palettes, Bright Winter and True Spring both share Bright Spring’s aspects of bright and warm, respectively.

      "Since Bright Spring flows from Winter, black is included in the palette. But the best versions of black for Bright Spring are a slightly yellowish charcoal and a slightly greenish black. These are warmer and more suitable dark neutrals than the cool blue-black of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, black on its own is not flattering on a Bright Spring since you need vibrant colours to lift your appearance. It’s better to mix it with some of the other warmer, more saturated colours on the palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also darker greyish browns and warm blues which you can also use as dark neutrals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft white, a more yellowish off-white, and gentle greens act as light neutrals. These are slightly warmer than the cool, harsh whites of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the main colour aspects of Bright Spring are brightness and warmth, your worst colours are muted and cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desaturated, toned-down colours, such as dusty blues and muddy browns, will dampen your natural brightness and make you look muddy.\n",

      "Colour Combinations\n",
      "Technically, you can combine any of the colours on the Bright Spring palette with each other. But certain combinations will look much better than others. Those are the combinations that repeat the contrast level that is naturally present in your appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring’s natural appearance is highly contrasting because of its brightness. Therefore, the best colour combinations for your outfits are similarly contrasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obvious way to create contrast is by pairing a dark colour with a light colour, such as dark blue and light blue. This is called value contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this may not be enough contrast for a Bright Spring. Instead of value contrast, aim for hue contrast. Don’t be afraid to combine unlike colours - particularly those sitting opposite each other on the colour wheel, such as pink and green. The more unusual the combination, the more striking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other way you can create a high contrast is by combining a neutral with a bright accent colour. Either pair a dark neutral with a lighter, brighter accent colour or a light neutral and a different darker accent colour. Make sure to select different hues to create additional hue contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, always aim for at least one bright colour in your outfit. Avoid neutrals-only combinations, monochromatic looks and low contrast combinations. These will diminish your naturally vibrant colouring.\n",

      "Bright Spring is the combination of bright and warm. This season flows into Spring from Winter, which tints skin, hair, and eyes neutral-warm. The most prominent characteristic of Bright Springs is the clearness of their features, which gives them a bright, luminous and fresh appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To reflect the naturally clear colouring of this season, Bright Spring colours are extremely saturated and bright, only rivalled in their vibrancy by Bright Winter.\n",

      "Bright Spring Colour Wheel\n",
      "Bright Spring is one of the three Spring seasons and sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike Bright Winter, this season is warm. However, both are sister seasons, meaning they are both a blend of Winter and Spring, with Bright Winter leaning more towards the Winter palette and Bright Spring leaning more towards the Spring palette.\n",

      "I. Characteristics\n",
      "Please note: Do not worry too much if one characteristic of your appearance deviates from the below descriptions. You may still fall into this colour season if your overall appearance matches the profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are a Bright Spring if the primary colour aspect of your overall appearance is bright, and the secondary aspect is warm – meaning warm colours suit you more than cooler ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you look in the mirror, the first thing you notice about your colouring is that it is highly saturated. There is no greyness in any of your features, and your appearance is vibrant and bright. There is also a very high contrast between your skin, eyes and hair. Your eyes will probably be clear and perhaps sparkling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, your colouring has warmer undertones, meaning gold flatters your skin more than silver.\n",

      "The Features\n",
      "I. Eyes\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Eye Colours\n",
      "Bright Spring eyes are generally clear. Because of the high contrast with the whites of the eye, they typically stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "They can be blue, green, topaz or even brown as long as they are bright. Bright Spring eyes have warm undertones, and you may notice a sunburst pattern on the iris, which is typical for Spring eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "II. Skin\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Skin\n",
      "Bright Spring skin comes in a broad range of shades: from fair to tan. It has either neutral or neutral-warm undertones - meaning both gold and silver look good against it, but gold look somewhat better.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Hair\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Hair Colours\n",
      "Like the skin, the hair is typically warmer and tends to develop highlights when exposed to the sun. Medium golden to dark golden blonde with highlights are very common. But copper, auburn and medium brown with reddish undertones are also possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Contrast\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring has one of the highest contrast levels between skin, hair and eyes among the twelve colour season. There is even a high contrast between the iris and the whites of the eye. This is because brightness creates contrast. In the images below, you can see how the features all contrast rather than blend into each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Individuals who fall into the Bright Spring colour season are sometimes tricky to analyse - they may look like Bright Winters, with piercingly bright eyes and often relatively dark hair. Plus, both colour seasons' primary colour aspect is bright.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the distinguishing characteristic is the warmer, yellowish undertone of Bright Spring's features compared to Winter's cool, blue-tinted features. The colouring is slightly less intense and has a fresher feel than Bright Winter's harsher appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. The Colour Palette\n",
      "The Bright Spring colour palette is reminiscent of exotic summer holidays. From tropical waters to remote islands, these are the most saturated colours out of the twelve seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "These colours are vibrant, wild and vivid – the colours of tropical landscapes, plants and fruit. In the western part of the northern hemisphere, Bright Spring colours are present in the first spring flowers, announcing the end of the dark days of winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring colouring combines brightness with warmth. And while this colour season has the typical freshness that is characteristic of all the Spring seasons, it also has some of the crisp and starker contrast of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary aspect of the Bright Spring colour palette is its vibrancy. The colours are bright and highly saturated. These are the most intense of the Spring colours. But they do retain the relative lightness of the Spring family. And so the colours are warm, fresh and full of new life, like the first budding signs of spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "The palette features a broad range of hues with a heavy focus on pinks and jewel-like tones, such as turquoises and lime greens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colour Dimensions\n",
      "\n",
      "On the three dimensions of colour, Bright Spring has the following settings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hue\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of Bright Spring's secondary aspect, the colours lean towards the warm end of the scale but are not extremely warm. That means they contain more yellow than blue undertones. So even if you choose blue (the coolest colour), you will find only warmer shades with a tint of yellow. Some of these are the turquoises and pastel colours.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Value\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The colour palette ranges from light to dark, but it does not include very light or dark colours. Although you may find darker shades of blue, green and purple, these are only supporting colours. Most colours cluster around the middle of the value scale, leaning slightly towards the lighter end because of the greater concentration of yellow undertones.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Chroma\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with this colour season’s primary aspect, the colours are very high in chroma; meaning they are intensely bright and vibrant. Only the sister palette Bright Winter can rival this intensity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‍\n",
      "\n",
      "Sister Palettes\n",
      "Bright Spring sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart. The colour season falls at the Winter end of the Spring family. That's why its colours are brighter, slightly darker and less warm than those of True Spring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Bright Winter, the colours are similarly bright but warmer and slightly lighter. Winter's effect on Bright Spring is to turn up the saturation of Spring's naturally bright colours to maximum brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter also cools the colours somewhat. For example, Bright Winter’s fuchsias have been warmed up and introduced to the palette, but True Spring’s golden browns have been dropped.\n",
      "\n",
      "As sister palettes, Bright Winter and True Spring both share Bright Spring’s aspects of bright and warm, respectively. Depending on where you fall on the Bright Spring spectrum, you can borrow some colours from your sister palettes since they are close enough to the Bright Spring colour palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you lean more towards Bright Winter, opt for the warmer shades on the Bright Winter palette – such as Honeysuckle, Beetroot Purple or Foliage. Whereas if you lean more towards True Spring, choose the brighter colours on the True Spring palette – such as Pansy, Marina or Green Flash.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Styling\n",
      "\n",
      "Since Bright Spring flows from Winter, black is included in the palette. But the best versions of black for Bright Spring are a slightly yellowish charcoal and a slightly greenish black. These are warmer and more suitable dark neutrals than the cool blue-black of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, black on its own is not flattering on a Bright Spring since you need vibrant colours to lift your appearance. It’s better to mix it with some of the other warmer, more saturated colours on the palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also darker greyish browns and warm blues which you can also use as dark neutrals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft white, a more yellowish off-white, and gentle greens act as light neutrals. These are slightly warmer than the cool, harsh whites of Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the main colour aspects of Bright Spring are brightness and warmth, your worst colours are muted and cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Desaturated, toned-down colours, such as dusty blues and muddy browns, will dampen your natural brightness and make you look muddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very cool colours, such as icy blues and greys, will clash with your naturally warmer colouring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring Colours to Avoid\n",
      "‍\n",
      "Colour Combinations\n",
      "Technically, you can combine any of the colours on the Bright Spring palette with each other. But certain combinations will look much better than others. Those are the combinations that repeat the contrast level that is naturally present in your appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bright Spring’s natural appearance is highly contrasting because of its brightness. Therefore, the best colour combinations for your outfits are similarly contrasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obvious way to create contrast is by pairing a dark colour with a light colour, such as dark blue and light blue. This is called value contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this may not be enough contrast for a Bright Spring. Instead of value contrast, aim for hue contrast. Don’t be afraid to combine unlike colours - particularly those sitting opposite each other on the colour wheel, such as pink and green. The more unusual the combination, the more striking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other way you can create a high contrast is by combining a neutral with a bright accent colour. Either pair a dark neutral with a lighter, brighter accent colour or a light neutral and a different darker accent colour. Make sure to select different hues to create additional hue contrast.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, always aim for at least one bright colour in your outfit. Avoid neutrals-only combinations, monochromatic looks and low contrast combinations. These will diminish your naturally vibrant colouring.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Spring is the original Spring season in the four seasons colour analysis and sits between Bright Spring and Light Spring on the seasonal flow chart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its opposite season is True Autumn. And in contrast to the latter, True Spring’s appearance is bright and fresh instead of earthy and muted.\n",
      "\n",
      "True Spring is the combination of warm and bright. This season is the warmest of the Spring family, and therefore skin, hair and eyes have a very warm, sunny colouring. There is no trace of coolness in the appearance of a True Spring and like the other Spring seasons, they look fresh and glowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This season does not tolerate cool and muted colours and thus True Spring colours are intensely warm and quite saturated reminiscent of colouring pencils.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Light + Warm\n",
      "\n",
      "Light Spring is the combination of light and warm. This season flows from Spring into Summer and therefore has some of the typical Summer gentleness in the features. In addition, skin, hair and eyes are neutral-warm but are even lighter than those of the other two Spring seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order not to overpower the delicacy of this season, Light Spring colours are the lightest and least intense of the Spring family, but the palette is colourful like a box of sweets.\n",
