THE 12 COLOUR SEASONS
Complete Seasonal Guides
Twelve seasons colour analysis comprises four main seasons – Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. These are further divided into three sub-seasons each, resulting in twelve colour seasons in total. On the basis of the flow theory, all seasons flow into each other forming a full circle.

In this section, you can learn more about each colour season and access the comprehensive guides.

Spring
Spring is the season of renewal, painting the natural world in fresh, blooming colours. Consequently, Spring features are warm, bright and light, giving Springs an overall luminous and fresh appearance.

The Spring season is divided into three sub-seasons: Bright Spring, True Spring and Light Spring.

True Spring Colour Wheel
Bright + Warm

Bright Spring is the combination of bright and warm. This season flows into Spring from Winter, which tints skin, hair, and eyes neutral-warm. The most prominent characteristic of Bright Springs is the clearness of their features, which gives them a bright, luminous and fresh appearance.

To reflect the naturally clear colouring of this season, Bright Spring colours are extremely saturated and bright, only rivalled in their vibrancy by Bright Winter.

Bright Spring is bright and warm. This season’s colour palette is a set of wild, vibrant colours, whose intensity can only be rivalled by the colours on the Bright Winter palette.


Bright Spring Colour Wheel
Bright Spring is one of the three Spring seasons and sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart.

Unlike Bright Winter, this season is warm. However, both are sister seasons, meaning they are both a blend of Winter and Spring, with Bright Winter leaning more towards the Winter palette and Bright Spring leaning more towards the Spring palette.

I. Characteristics
Please note: Do not worry too much if one characteristic of your appearance deviates from the below descriptions. You may still fall into this colour season if your overall appearance matches the profile.

You are a Bright Spring if the primary colour aspect of your overall appearance is bright, and the secondary aspect is warm – meaning warm colours suit you more than cooler ones.

When you look in the mirror, the first thing you notice about your colouring is that it is highly saturated. There is no greyness in any of your features, and your appearance is vibrant and bright. There is also a very high contrast between your skin, eyes and hair. Your eyes will probably be clear and perhaps sparkling.


In addition, your colouring has warmer undertones, meaning gold flatters your skin more than silver.

The Features
I. Eyes


Bright Spring Eye Colours
Bright Spring eyes are generally clear. Because of the high contrast with the whites of the eye, they typically stand out.

They can be blue, green, topaz or even brown as long as they are bright. Bright Spring eyes have warm undertones, and you may notice a sunburst pattern on the iris, which is typical for Spring eyes.

‍

II. Skin

Bright Spring Skin
Bright Spring skin comes in a broad range of shades: from fair to tan. It has either neutral or neutral-warm undertones - meaning both gold and silver look good against it, but gold look somewhat better.

‍


III. Hair

Bright Spring Hair Colours
Like the skin, the hair is typically warmer and tends to develop highlights when exposed to the sun. Medium golden to dark golden blonde with highlights are very common. But copper, auburn and medium brown with reddish undertones are also possible.

‍

IV. Contrast

Bright Spring has one of the highest contrast levels between skin, hair and eyes among the twelve colour season. There is even a high contrast between the iris and the whites of the eye. This is because brightness creates contrast. In the images below, you can see how the features all contrast rather than blend into each other.

Individuals who fall into the Bright Spring colour season are sometimes tricky to analyse - they may look like Bright Winters, with piercingly bright eyes and often relatively dark hair. Plus, both colour seasons' primary colour aspect is bright.

However, the distinguishing characteristic is the warmer, yellowish undertone of Bright Spring's features compared to Winter's cool, blue-tinted features. The colouring is slightly less intense and has a fresher feel than Bright Winter's harsher appearance.

II. The Colour Palette
The Bright Spring colour palette is reminiscent of exotic summer holidays. From tropical waters to remote islands, these are the most saturated colours out of the twelve seasons.

These colours are vibrant, wild and vivid – the colours of tropical landscapes, plants and fruit. In the western part of the northern hemisphere, Bright Spring colours are present in the first spring flowers, announcing the end of the dark days of winter.

Bright Spring colouring combines brightness with warmth. And while this colour season has the typical freshness that is characteristic of all the Spring seasons, it also has some of the crisp and starker contrast of Winter.

The primary aspect of the Bright Spring colour palette is its vibrancy. The colours are bright and highly saturated. These are the most intense of the Spring colours. But they do retain the relative lightness of the Spring family. And so the colours are warm, fresh and full of new life, like the first budding signs of spring.

The palette features a broad range of hues with a heavy focus on pinks and jewel-like tones, such as turquoises and lime greens.

Colour Dimensions

On the three dimensions of colour, Bright Spring has the following settings:

Hue

Because of Bright Spring's secondary aspect, the colours lean towards the warm end of the scale but are not extremely warm. That means they contain more yellow than blue undertones. So even if you choose blue (the coolest colour), you will find only warmer shades with a tint of yellow. Some of these are the turquoises and pastel colours.

‍

Value


The colour palette ranges from light to dark, but it does not include very light or dark colours. Although you may find darker shades of blue, green and purple, these are only supporting colours. Most colours cluster around the middle of the value scale, leaning slightly towards the lighter end because of the greater concentration of yellow undertones.

‍

Chroma

In line with this colour season’s primary aspect, the colours are very high in chroma; meaning they are intensely bright and vibrant. Only the sister palette Bright Winter can rival this intensity.

‍

Sister Palettes
Bright Spring sits between Bright Winter and True Spring on the seasonal flow chart. The colour season falls at the Winter end of the Spring family. That's why its colours are brighter, slightly darker and less warm than those of True Spring.

Compared to Bright Winter, the colours are similarly bright but warmer and slightly lighter. Winter's effect on Bright Spring is to turn up the saturation of Spring's naturally bright colours to maximum brightness.

Winter also cools the colours somewhat. For example, Bright Winter’s fuchsias have been warmed up and introduced to the palette, but True Spring’s golden browns have been dropped.

As sister palettes, Bright Winter and True Spring both share Bright Spring’s aspects of bright and warm, respectively. Depending on where you fall on the Bright Spring spectrum, you can borrow some colours from your sister palettes since they are close enough to the Bright Spring colour palette.


If you lean more towards Bright Winter, opt for the warmer shades on the Bright Winter palette – such as Honeysuckle, Beetroot Purple or Foliage. Whereas if you lean more towards True Spring, choose the brighter colours on the True Spring palette – such as Pansy, Marina or Green Flash.

III. Styling

Since Bright Spring flows from Winter, black is included in the palette. But the best versions of black for Bright Spring are a slightly yellowish charcoal and a slightly greenish black. These are warmer and more suitable dark neutrals than the cool blue-black of Winter.

Besides, black on its own is not flattering on a Bright Spring since you need vibrant colours to lift your appearance. It’s better to mix it with some of the other warmer, more saturated colours on the palette.

There are also darker greyish browns and warm blues which you can also use as dark neutrals.

A soft white, a more yellowish off-white, and gentle greens act as light neutrals. These are slightly warmer than the cool, harsh whites of Winter.

Since the main colour aspects of Bright Spring are brightness and warmth, your worst colours are muted and cool.

Desaturated, toned-down colours, such as dusty blues and muddy browns, will dampen your natural brightness and make you look muddy.

Very cool colours, such as icy blues and greys, will clash with your naturally warmer colouring.

Bright Spring Colours to Avoid
‍
Colour Combinations
Technically, you can combine any of the colours on the Bright Spring palette with each other. But certain combinations will look much better than others. Those are the combinations that repeat the contrast level that is naturally present in your appearance.

Bright Spring’s natural appearance is highly contrasting because of its brightness. Therefore, the best colour combinations for your outfits are similarly contrasting.

The obvious way to create contrast is by pairing a dark colour with a light colour, such as dark blue and light blue. This is called value contrast.

However, this may not be enough contrast for a Bright Spring. Instead of value contrast, aim for hue contrast. Don’t be afraid to combine unlike colours - particularly those sitting opposite each other on the colour wheel, such as pink and green. The more unusual the combination, the more striking.

The other way you can create a high contrast is by combining a neutral with a bright accent colour. Either pair a dark neutral with a lighter, brighter accent colour or a light neutral and a different darker accent colour. Make sure to select different hues to create additional hue contrast.

In general, always aim for at least one bright colour in your outfit. Avoid neutrals-only combinations, monochromatic looks and low contrast combinations. These will diminish your naturally vibrant colouring.

True Spring is the original Spring season in the four seasons colour analysis and sits between Bright Spring and Light Spring on the seasonal flow chart.

Its opposite season is True Autumn. And in contrast to the latter, True Spring’s appearance is bright and fresh instead of earthy and muted.

True Spring is the combination of warm and bright. This season is the warmest of the Spring family, and therefore skin, hair and eyes have a very warm, sunny colouring. There is no trace of coolness in the appearance of a True Spring and like the other Spring seasons, they look fresh and glowing.

This season does not tolerate cool and muted colours and thus True Spring colours are intensely warm and quite saturated reminiscent of colouring pencils.


Light + Warm

Light Spring is the combination of light and warm. This season flows from Spring into Summer and therefore has some of the typical Summer gentleness in the features. In addition, skin, hair and eyes are neutral-warm but are even lighter than those of the other two Spring seasons.

In order not to overpower the delicacy of this season, Light Spring colours are the lightest and least intense of the Spring family, but the palette is colourful like a box of sweets.

II. True Spring Colour Palette
True Spring is the colour season reminiscent of sunshine, tropical islands with turquoise water, yellow sand, lush green leaves and juicy fruit. The colours are warm and fresh, taking in the light of the warming spring sun.
The palette contains the saturated colours of spring flowers, freshly grown grass, and green leaves. True Spring is spring at its peak.
True Spring is the original Spring season of the four seasons colour analysis and is the ‘standard’ Spring palette. The other two Spring palettes have been modified to accommodate the respective Winter and Summer influence.

True Spring colouring combines warmth with brightness. This season falls at the warmest, most golden end of Spring. Therefore, the colours are warm with a clear yellow undertone. There is not a hint of coolness in this palette.

The True Spring palette contains warm greens, yellows, orangey reds, peachy pinks and every shade of light brown from beige to tan. These colours are naturally yellow-based and warm.

Although Spring is, in general, a season of lighter colours, True Spring’s colours go deeper and are more saturated than might be expected.

Colour Dimensions

Hue

Consistent with True Spring’s primary aspect, the palette sits at the warmest end of the hue scale. That means the colours contain yellow undertones but no blue ones. As a result, you will find very few shades of blue (which is the coolest colour of all) on the palette. And you will only see warmer shades of blue – such as turquoise, mint, or pastel blue – that contain a tint of yellow. Instead, there are more yellows, peachy pinks and warm greens that are naturally yellow-based.

Value

The colour palette is quite broad, but it is lighter in value because of the greater concentration of yellow undertones. There are no extremely dark colours on the palette. But you may find darker shades of blue or purple, which are supportive colours for the lighter tints.

‍Chroma

In line with True Spring’s secondary colour aspect, the colours are high in chroma. That means they are saturated and bright rather than faded.

Consistent with True Spring’s primary aspect, the palette sits at the warmest end of the hue scale. That means the colours contain yellow undertones but no blue ones. As a result, you will find very few shades of blue (which is the coolest colour of all) on the palette. And you will only see warmer shades of blue – such as turquoise, mint, or pastel blue – that contain a tint of yellow. Instead, there are more yellows, peachy pinks and warm greens that are naturally yellow-based.

Value

The colour palette is quite broad, but it is lighter in value because of the greater concentration of yellow undertones. There are no extremely dark colours on the palette. But you may find darker shades of blue or purple, which are supportive colours for the lighter tints.


Chroma

In line with True Spring’s secondary colour aspect, the colours are high in chroma. That means they are saturated and bright rather than faded.

‍

Sister Palettes
True Spring sits between Bright Spring and Light Spring on the seasonal flow chart. As the heart of Spring, the colours are bright, medium in value and very warm.

With their opposite season True Autumn, the colours share the same warmth but are brighter and lighter. True Autumn colours are muted and appear earthier.

Compared to Bright Spring, the colours are warmer, softer and slightly lighter. True Spring is not influenced by Winter.

Compared to the third Spring season Light Spring, the colours are warmer, brighter and slightly darker.

As sister palettes, Bright Spring and Light Spring both share True Spring’s aspects of bright and warm, respectively. Depending on where you fall on the True Spring spectrum, you can borrow some colours from your sister palettes since they are close enough to the True Spring colour palette.

If you lean more towards Bright Spring, opt for the gentler shades on the Bright Spring palette – such as Artisan's Gold, Persimmon or Tropical green. Whereas if you lean more towards Light Spring, choose the darker colours on the Light Spring palette – such as Hot Coral, Teaberry or Poison Green.

III. Styling
Neutrals

True black and white (two Winter colours) are not on the True Spring colour palette. These colours are too cool and harsh for your colouring and can make you look sallow. To replace black, you have warm chocolate browns and greenish greys, which you can use as dark neutrals.

For your light neutrals, you have light yellows and greens instead of whites. These are warmer and gentler than pure white.

In general, browns and even beiges (if they are bright enough) are the best True Spring neutrals, because they are naturally warmer hues.
Summer
Summer is the season of long days in the sun coupled with a gentle, cooling breeze coming from the waterside. The intense sunlight paints the natural world in delicate colours. Consequently, Summer features are cool, light and muted, giving Summers an overall gentle and delicate appearance.

The Summer season is divided into three sub-seasons: Light Summer, True Summer and Soft Summer.

True Summer Colour Wheel
Light + Cool

Light Summer is the combination of light and cool. This season flows into Summer from Spring, which tints skin, hair and eyes neutral-cool and makes this Summer type slightly brighter than the other two. And since all features are similarly light, the contrast between them is very low.

To match the gentle but brighter appearance, Light Summer colours are light and delicate but still fairly colourful like various flavours of ice cream.

Cool + Muted

True Summer is the combination of cool and muted. As the coolest season of the Summer family, the features lack any form of warmth. Instead, they are overlaid with a coolness that is gentle not frosty. Similarly, their features are gently contrasted. There are no stark contrasts and no harshly-coloured features.

This colour season does not tolerate warm and bright colours. And hence True Summer colours are very cool and toned down like a dive into cold water.

Muted + Cool

Soft Summer is the combination of muted and cool. This season flows from Summer into Autumn, tinting skin, hair and eyes neutral-cool. Soft Summer has the softest colouring of the already muted Summer family. The features are gently greyed out, giving Soft Summers a blended appearance.

Soft Summers don't tolerate brightness at all, and their colours are therefore extremely toned down so as not to overwhelm their gentle colouring.

Autumn
Autumn is the season of harvest and shorter, foggy days, which envelope the natural world in hazy, rich colours. Consequently, Autumn features are warm, muted and dark, giving Autumns a rich but toned down appearance.

The Autumn season is divided into three sub-seasons: Soft Autumn, True Autumn and Dark Autumn.

Muted + Warm

Soft Autumn is the combination of muted and warm. This season flows into Autumn from Summer, which tints skin, hair and eyes neutral-warm. Soft Autumn has the softest colouring of the already muted Autumn family. The features are gently greyed out, giving Soft Autumns a blended appearance.

Soft Autumns don't tolerate brightness at all. The colour palette is therefore extremely toned down and understated. It contains lots of nuts, rose and wheat colours.

Warm + Muted

True Autumn is the combination of warm and muted. Being the warmest season of the Autumn family, True Autumn features have a rich colouring, which may appear saturated because of its warmth, but it's muted. This season has the richest appearance out of the Autumn family.

Like Autumn foliage, the True Autumn colour palette comprises rich, earthy colours, which appear very saturated because of their warmth. But they are rich rather than bright.

Dark + Warm

Dark Autumn is the combination of dark and warm. This season flows from Autumn into Winter, tinting skin, hair and eyes neutral-warm. Another effect of Winter is the higher contrast between the features and the increased brightness compared to the other two Autumn seasons. Dark Winter colouring tends to have a bronzy glow.

The warm colours of the True Autumn palette become deeper and slightly brighter on the Dark Autumn colour palette reminiscent of spices.

Winter
Winter is the season of extreme contrast, with long nights plunging the natural world into darkness and white snow covering the ground. Consequently, Winter features are cool, bright and dark, giving Winters a highly contrasted, brilliant appearance.

The Winter season is divided into three sub-seasons: Dark Winter, True Winter and Bright Winter.

True Winter Colour Wheel
Dark + Cool

Dark Winter is the combination of dark and cool. This season flows into Winter from Autumn, which makes skin, hair and eyes neutral-cool. Dark Winters are recognised by the deep colouring of hair and eyes set against lighter skin. This creates prominent dark features. This colouring is the darkest of the Winter family.

To reflect the high value contrast, the Dark Winter palette comprises very light and very dark colours with the typical Winter brilliance.

Cool + Bright

True Winter is the combination of cool and bright. Being the coolest season of the Winter family, True Winter features are overlaid with a frost-like coolness. Like the other two Winter types, True Winters have a highly contrasted, brilliant appearance but with added coolness.

To match the coolness in the natural colouring, the True Winter colour palette boasts both light, icy pastels and dark, bright colours to achieve a high contrast.

Bright + Cool

Bright Winter is the combination of bright and cool. This season flows from Winter into Spring, which tints skin, hair and eyes neutral-cool. Like Bright Spring, the most prominent characteristic of Bright Winter is the clear appearance of the features. Their brilliance and vibrance are striking and cannot be overlooked.

Bright Winter colours are extremely bright and vibrant, as any less extreme colour would not be enough for their intense, saturated appearance.
